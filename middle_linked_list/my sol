lass Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        count = 0
        current = head
        while current :
            current = current.next
            count+=1
        #Mid is at count//2
        current = head
        mid = count//2
        while mid>0:
            current = current.next
            mid-=1
        print(current.val)
        return current
